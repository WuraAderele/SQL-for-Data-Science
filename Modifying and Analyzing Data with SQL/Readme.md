## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Coding Questions & üöÄ Solutions
### 1. Pull a list of customer ids with the customer‚Äôs full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE. (e.g. LOS ANGELES USA)
  
                SELECT CustomerId
                  ,(Customers.FirstName || " " || Customers.LastName) AS CustomerFullName
                  ,(Customers.Address || ", " || UPPER(Customers.City) || " " || UPPER(Customers.Country)) AS CustomerAddress
                FROM Customers
 
### 2. Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letters of the employee‚Äôs first name with the first 2 letters of the employee‚Äôs last name. Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.
  
                SELECT LOWER(SUBSTR(Customers.FirstName, 1, 4) || SUBSTR(Customers.Lastname, 1, 2)) AS NewID
                FROM Customers
  
 ### 3. Show a list of employees who have worked for the company for 15 or more years using the current date function. Sort by lastname ascending.

                SELECT FirstName
                ,LastName
                ,HireDate
                ,(STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', HireDate)) - (STRFTIME('%m-%d', 'now') < STRFTIME('%m-%d', HireDate)) AS YearsWorked
              FROM Employees
              WHERE YearsWorked >= 15
              ORDER BY LastName ASC
  
### 4.   Profiling the Customers table, answer the following question. Are there any columns with null values?

              SELECT *
              FROM Customers
              WHERE Fax IS NULL;

### 5. Find the cities with the most customers and rank in descending order.

                SELECT City
                  ,Count(DISTINCT (CustomerID)) AS NumofCustomers
                FROM Customers
                GROUP BY City
                ORDER BY NumofCustomers DESC LIMIT 7  
  
### 6. Create a new customer invoice id by combining a customer‚Äôs invoice id with their first and last name while ordering your query in the following order: firstname, lastname, and invoiceID.

              SELECT Customers.FirstName
                ,Customers.LastName
                ,(Customers.FirstName || Customers.LastName || Invoices.InvoiceId) AS NewInvoiceId
              FROM Customers
              JOIN Invoices ON Customers.CustomerId = Invoices.CustomerId
              WHERE NewInvoiceId LIKE "AstridGruber%"
              ORDER BY FirstName
                ,LastName
                ,InvoiceId;
